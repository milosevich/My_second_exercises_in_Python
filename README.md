# My_second_exercises_in_Python
These are some of my exercises that I have done while continue learning Python:

- combine_lists.py - Take 2 lists as input and return a new list consisting of the elements of the first list followed by the elements of the second list. In this example input is "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] and fruits = ['apples', 'bananas', 'grapes', 'peaches', 'apricots']"
   
- dash_stringify.py - Given a list of word strings, return a single string with all the strings together, with ' - ' in between the words. In this example input is ['A', 'B', 'C']

- get_word_codes.py - Given a list of words, return a dictionary where the words are keys, and the value for each key is a list of the character codes of the letters of the word that is its key.

- last_n_elements.py - Given a sequence and a number n, return the last n elements of the sequence. In this example input is ['apples', 'grapes', 'peaches', 'apricots', 'bananas'] and we return last 3 elements.

- last_n_reversed.py - Given a sequence and a number n, return the last n elements of the sequence in reversed order. In this example input is ['apples', 'grapes', 'peaches', 'apricots', 'bananas'] and we return last 3 elements.

- leap_year.py - Given a year, return True if it is a leap year, else return False.

- matrix_fill.py - Given number of rows and number of columns, create a matrix (list of lists) where each element is sequentially numbered. In this example input is (5, 3)

- perfect_square.py - Given a number, return True if it is a perfect square, else return False.

- power_list.py - Given a list of numbers, return a new list where each element is the corresponding element of the list to the power of the list index.

- rotate_list.py - Take a list as input and remove the first item from the list and add it to the end of the list. Return the item moved.

- silly_case.py - Given a string, convert it to a string such that each word starts with a lower case letter, and the remaining letters are uppercase. Return the silly case string.
